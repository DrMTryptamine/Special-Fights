# Special-Fights

; Script created using AutoHotKey ; In the BUILD-Create screen Create clones if not max: ON ; Auto-buy missing creations OFF ; In the BUILD-Monuments screen Stop after finish: OFF ; Auto-buy missing creations ON ; In the GOD POINTS screen Boni can be in MYSTIC or NOTHING

If these criteria are not met, the script will not function properly

The timings in this script are set for 500k clones - 30 CC - 4380 bs - 2275 cs Press backspace to STOP Press Shift+P to PAUSE

I am working on compiling all of these scripts into one working bot with a neat GUI. Currently i'm making the body of the scripts using timed pauses, that work with my current game. There are still a few more to come like this. I am working on creating the variables to start including functions and IF statements. [Enter clones] + [Enter BS] + [Enter CC] + [Enter CS] = set time to x
